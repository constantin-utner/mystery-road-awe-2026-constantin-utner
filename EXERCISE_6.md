# Exercise 6 — Effects, Data Fetching & a Backend

This is the sixth exercise in Advanced Web Engineering Course (CSDC). It builds on Exercises 3–5. All 5 views should already be fully working in React, reading their data from the static `data/*.json` files. This exercise replaces those static files with a small **Node.js backend**, and uses that to properly teach effects, loading/error/empty states, and request cancellation. Things that are hard to demonstrate convincingly against files that can only ever be "instant" or
"404."

**Scope of the backend, deliberately kept small:** a minimal Node server (Express or equivalent) that serves the same 5 JSON files as **read-only** REST endpoints. No write endpoints, no persistence. Bookmarks, notes, and the hypothesis draft stay in `localStorage` exactly as before. Only *reading* the case data moves to the network. **The backend runs locally in development only, it is not deployed.** Exercise 2's GitHub Pages workflow still builds and deploys the static frontend. Wiring up a real deployed backend is out of scope here.

## Demo 1 — Render logic vs. effects

**Tasks**

- [ ] Find (or deliberately write, then remove) an example of a **side effect performed directly
during a component's render**. For example, mutating a variable outside the component,
calling `console.log` for debugging on every render, or reading `localStorage` inline in the
function body instead of in an effect, and explain why it's a side effect even though it
"seems to work."
- [ ] Write, in your own words, a short rule for what belongs in render versus what belongs in an effect.

**Questions** (depend on the tasks above)

- [ ] Why can React call a component's render function more than once, or at times you don't
expect (e.g. in development with Strict Mode)? What would go wrong with the side-effect
example you found if render ran twice?
- [ ] Is calculating a derived value (like the filtered evidence list from Exercise 5) a side
effect? Why or why not, and how does that distinction inform the rule you wrote?

---

## Demo 2 — `useEffect` mental model & dependency arrays

**Tasks**

- [ ] Write a small `useEffect` example (can be a throwaway one first) with an empty dependency
array, one with a populated dependency array, and one with no array at all, and observe how
often each one actually runs.
- [ ] Find a real, justified use for `useEffect` you'll need in this app (loading data is coming in Demo 5, so pick something else — e.g. syncing the document title to the current view).

**Questions** (depend on the tasks above)

- [ ] What does React actually compare, between renders, to decide whether to re-run an effect with a populated dependency array? What happens if you omit a value your effect actually uses from that array?
- [ ] What's the difference, in practice, between `useEffect(fn, [])` and just writing `fn()` directly in the component body? Why doesn't the second one work the way you'd expect for "run once"?

---

## Demo 3 — Cleanup: timers & subscriptions

**Tasks**

- [ ] Implement at least one effect that sets up something needing cleanup (a `setTimeout`/
`setInterval`, a `window` event listener, or similar) and returns a proper cleanup function.
- [ ] Demonstrate what happens (e.g. via a console log in both the effect and its cleanup) when the component unmounts or the dependencies change, with and without the cleanup function present.

**Questions** (depend on the tasks above)

- [ ] What actually calls your cleanup function, and when? Name at least two distinct situations that trigger it.
- [ ] What real, observable bug would you get in this app if you set up a subscription/timer in an effect but forgot the cleanup function? Be specific, not just "a memory leak."

---

## Demo 4 — Build the read-only Node backend

**Tasks**

- [ ] Set up a minimal Node.js server (Express or equivalent) with one GET endpoint per data
resource (case, evidence, people, locations, timeline), each returning the same shape of data
as the corresponding `data/*.json` file does today.
- [ ] Add a way to deliberately simulate real-world conditions for testing later demos: an artificial delay (configurable, e.g. via a query param or env var) on at least one endpoint, and a way to make one endpoint return an error response (e.g. a 500) on demand.
- [ ] Confirm the server runs locally alongside `vite dev` and is documented (a README section is enough) as dev-only (not part of the Exercise 2 deploy pipeline).

**Questions** (depend on the tasks above)

- [ ] Why does this exercise ask for artificial delay/error controls on the backend, instead of just pointing the frontend at the static JSON files directly (as it already could)? What could you *not* teach convincingly without them?
- [ ] What is CORS, and did you have to deal with it running your frontend (from Vite's dev server) against this separate backend server? If yes, what did you configure and why? If no, why not?

---

## Demo 5 — Consume the backend from React

**Tasks**

- [ ] Replace at least one view's data source (previously the static `data/*.json` fetch/import) with a real `fetch()` call to your new backend, wired up inside a `useEffect`.
- [ ] Do the same for the rest of the app's data sources, so the whole app now reads from your backend rather than static files.

**Questions** (depend on the tasks above)

- [ ] Walk through exactly what happens, in order, from the component mounting to the data actually being available to render: what does the effect do, when does it run, and what causes the component to re-render once the data arrives?
- [ ] What's different about your component now compared to before (when data came from a static
import/fetch of a local file). Specifically in terms of what state it needs to track that it
didn't need before?

---

## Demo 6 — Loading, error, and empty states

**Tasks**

- [ ] For at least one view, implement all three states explicitly: a loading indicator while the fetch is pending, a real error message if it fails (using your backend's on-demand error endpoint from Demo 4 to trigger it live), and a distinct "no data" empty state if the response is successful but contains nothing.
- [ ] Make sure these three states are visually and structurally distinguishable from each other, not all three collapsing into "shows nothing."

**Questions** (depend on the tasks above)

- [ ] Trigger your backend's error endpoint live and show the error state appearing. What state variable(s) are you tracking to distinguish "loading," "error," and "loaded successfully but empty" from each other?
- [ ] The original vanilla app had a bug where a failed fetch could leave a loading spinner stuck forever because the cleanup/hide-loading step was never called on the error path. Explain specifically how your React version's state management makes that particular mistake
harder to make (or show that it doesn't, and fix it).

---

## Demo 7 — Request races & cancellation

**Tasks**

- [ ] Using your backend's artificial-delay control, construct a request race: trigger a request, then trigger another one (for the same data) before the first resolves, and observe
what happens if you do nothing special about it. Does the UI ever show a result from the
*older* request after a newer one already resolved?
- [ ] Fix it using `AbortController` (or a request-id/"ignore stale response" guard, your choice), so the UI can never show a stale result.

**Questions** (depend on the tasks above)

- [ ] Reproduce the race live (with artificial delay dialed up) before your fix, then show the fix preventing it. What exact sequence of events causes the stale result to win without the fix?
- [ ] `AbortController` cancels the *request*. Does the effect's cleanup function run separately, or is aborting the fetch itself what you're doing inside the cleanup? Explain how the two connect in your implementation.

---

## Demo 8 — Extract a reusable custom hook

**Tasks**

- [ ] Extract the data-fetching logic (loading/error/empty state, the effect, cancellation) you've built across Demos 5–7 into at least one reusable custom hook (e.g. `useFetch<T>(url)` or a more specific `useEvidence()`), and use it in at least two different places.

**Questions** (depend on the tasks above)

- [ ] What makes something a legitimate custom hook rather than just a regular helper function? What rule(s) does React enforce about how/where hooks (including your custom one) can be called?
- [ ] Show the two places using your hook. What did extracting it save you from duplicating, and is there anything about the two usages that *couldn't* be shared and had to stay specific to each call site?

---

## Demo 9 — Separate UI, application logic, and API access

**Tasks**

- [ ] Organize your data-fetching code into distinct layers: a thin API-access layer (raw `fetch` calls, knows the backend's URLs/shapes and nothing else), your custom hook(s) from Demo 8 (application logic: loading/error/cancellation), and your components (UI only, no direct `fetch` calls anywhere in a component).
- [ ] Confirm no component in the app calls `fetch` directly anymore.

**Questions** (depend on the tasks above)

- [ ] If your backend's endpoint URLs or response shape changed tomorrow, how many files would you need to touch, and which ones? Would any component need to change?
- [ ] What's the argument *against* this separation for a small app like this one? E.g. when would the extra layering be overkill rather than helpful? Do you think it's justified here?

---

## Demo 10 — Data-flow wrap-up & a written UX decision

**Tasks**

- [ ] Illustrate the full data flow for one piece of data, end to end: the JSON file -> your backend endpoint -> the API-access layer -> your custom hook -> the component -> what's on screen.
- [ ] Explain a short, honest justification for one loading/error/empty-state UX decision you made (e.g. what your loading indicator looks like, how errors are worded, what "empty" looks like) and note one thing you'd do differently with more time.

**Questions** (depend on the tasks above)

- [ ] Walk through your diagram/illustration live, and for one step, explain what would break (and how you'd notice) if that step silently stopped happening.
- [ ] Across Exercises 3–6, this app went from "read static files instantly" to "fetch from a real, sometimes-slow, sometimes-failing server". What did that change force you to add that wasn't needed before and was any of it needed *conceptually* even back when the data source was a static file, just less visible?
